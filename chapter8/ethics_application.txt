Summary of the research:

  Aim of Study:
  We are interested in how real-time animal tracking data can be used to
  represent the activity from the source. Real-time data from a remote colony of
  naked mole-rats is used to control a set of small kinetic objects. This study
  seeks to gain an understanding of how participants respond to real-time
  biological data through the physical representation, and whether a connection
  to nature (the source) is developed.
  
  Recruitment:
  The aim is to gather data through a questionnaire and semi-structured
  interviews from a sample of 20-30 participants from the general public aged 16
  and above. Participants will be recruited via direct contact using email and
  social media. Each will  be provided with an information sheet and consent
  form,  explaining the purpose  of the study and the way that the data will be
  stored and used. Benefit to the participants will be through access to the
  completed research.

  Method:
  Participants will be briefed, asked to sign consent form, and then instructed
  to view the artworks alone in a controlled studio environment for a short
  period of time. They will then complete a questionnaire to assess their
  connection to nature through the movement of the object. Groups of
  participants will receive differing briefing information about the study to
  enable us to look for difference in response depending on prior knowledge. A
  number of participants will be interviewed after the observation.

  Data Collection:
  Demographic information will be collected, personal data, such as email
  addresses, telephone numbers, and geographic addresses will be stored separately to the interview data on an
  EECS secure server with limited user access. All participants data will be
  anonymised. During the study participants will be asked permission for audio
  recording and video footage to be captured. Parts of the audio transcribed and stored  on the researchers computer. The recordings are for analysis and not for reproduction elsewhere. They will be destroyed after the study has concluded.

  Risk:
  The study is akin to visiting an art gallery and being asked questions about
  the experience. It is considered low risk. There will be no contact with the
  animals.


  Example questions:
  * Please give an explanation for the movement in the objects?
  * How are the objects moving? (pre-filled list of multiple choice answers)
  * If you had to choose one behaviour from the list above, what would it be?

  For selected participants:
  * Data from the naked mole-rat locations and activities move the objects. Does
  this impact your perception of the objects? In which way?
